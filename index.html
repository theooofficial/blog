   <p>----------------------------<p>
 <p>i now have very sad news: m**** said that k**** may have a crush on him. i feel like there is no hope anymore. Whenever she chooses to hang out with m**** rather than me, it makes me feel like im not good enough for her, and i know i'm not. She would never like a horrible student like me. I just wish something great would happen but every time i pray, it never happens. BUT Even though she is my crush, she is my bestie before that. She is a great friend and i will never stop being her friend<p>
