 <p>Today/Yesterday i asked k**** what she would do if i asked her out and what she would do ma**y asked her out. She said no to me and maybe to ma**y. I don't know what to do. I cant just give up, i love her and would do anything for her. She is very sweet yet she can be sour (that was a metaphor), she has the most beautiful hair color and she is very unique. Even though she is really cute, Her personality is what infected me with the love-bug. I probably wont have a crush on her forever but i will always be her admirer. even if she and ma**y become a couple. (definition: a person who has a particular regard for someone). <p>
